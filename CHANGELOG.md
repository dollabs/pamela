# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This change log follows the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/).

### [Unreleased]

Changes
* Fixed pamela launch script (Closes #72)
* Changed default output to json (Closes #74)
* Ensure that jenkins.sh will pass
* Fixed test to put temporary/generated files under target/
* Updated plan-schema dependency to 0.2.16
* Make it explicit that there can't be multiple levels of ( parallel | sequence | choose ) in a
  defpmethod used for HTN generation (Closes #57)
* HTN and TPN schema updates (one of many steps on Issue #43)
* Avoid recursive resolve-plant-class call at the end of the ancestry-path (Closes #82)
* Check method call arity in IR generation (if possible) (Closes #83)
* Improved field arg validation (Closes #87)

### [0.6.0] - 2017-03-08

Changes
* Grammar changes: allow underscores in symbols
* Parsing changes: allow plant-function symbols to refer to fields
  (if not present in method or pclass args)
* Validate pclass-ctor args
  - keywords must be one of #{:id :interface :plant-part} or a field
  - symbols must be a formal pclass arg or a field (when converted to kw)
- Complex (nested) root-task elaboration
  First symbol is HTN pclass, ultimate symbol is the method, and
  intermediate symbols (if any) are fields from the previous pclass.
  Arguments may be literals or fields qualified by pclass (and zero
  or more intermediate fields).
- HTN progagation proceeds normally when HTN and TPN are not hand-coded.
- HTN now has all the attributes required to generate the TPN
  :name
  :display-name ;; preformatted in camelCase without args
  :command (duplicate of :name)
  :args
  :argsmap
  :plantid
  :plant-part
  :interface
- TPN activities now have all plant instance details
  (:id :plant-part :interface)
- Delays are represented as type :delay-activity
- Temporal constraints for activities on attached to the activity
  (rather than the begin node).
- Fixed jenkins.sh
- Updated documents in doc/
- Update tests with new gensym to compare IR output
- Update pamela launch script to better escape root-tasks
- Updated dependencies
- Add dbg-println, a configurable alternative to using println for debugging.
   - Behavior is controlled by dbg-println-mode and *dbg-println-level* (and the current logging
     level if dbg-println-mode=:log)
- Resolution of argument resolution bug
- Determine pclass of unabiguous (but unspecified) pmethods
- Handle 5 canonical HTN source examples, including finding the appropriate plant initializer, such
  that the argument values and other plant info is propagated appropriately
- Resolved a number of problems with argument resolution (handling multiple use cases)
- Handle top-level HTN method consisting of a choice
- Updated TPN object hierarchy to include :cost<=-constraint and :reward>=-constraint
- Move constraints from Nodes to Activities when appropriate

### [0.5.0] - 2016-12-08

Changes
* Fixed HTN generation for elaborated primitive methods (Closes #39)
* Switched build tool from lein to boot
* Streamlined the directory layout
* Updated tests
* Created master install script: pamela-setup
* Fixed HTN generation for elaborated primitive methods (Closes #39)
* Fixed parser bug with floating point numbers

### [0.4.3] - 2016-11-18

Added
- Better support for magic files (including --output-magic)
- Fixed minor bugs with the pamela launcher
- Ensured top level actions properly return an exit code
- Quieted the intial logging by the netty (dependency of aleph)
- Properly handle default plant bounds as lvars
- Changed default PAMELA_MODE=prod in ./bin/pamela (requires uberjar)
- Updated grammar to ensure reserved words are not interpreted
  as plant functions
- Added semantic check to validate the unqualifed plant functions
  are defined elsewhere in the PAMELA class
- Changed dependencies
  * Upgraded clojurescript, clj-time
  * Downgraded lein-cljsbuild to avoid migration to the new format
  * Downgraded org.omcljs/om to 1.0.0-alpha40 to avoid breakage
- Redesigned input-file and output-file processing (to expand-home
  and prepend the current working directory as needed)
- Fixed missing plantid slot in TPN output
- Fix --output-magic to properly list input filenames and save as EDN
  Closes #37
- This is planned to be the last version with pamelad and database
  functionality

  in parallel and choice blocks
