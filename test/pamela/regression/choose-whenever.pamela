;; BTW: Is it posssible/meaningful to set the value of a local field?  If so, what's the syntax?
;; We have NOT defined mutations like that... Generally PAMELA tries to
;; be declarative (not imperative). In this case I think it's more likely
;; for the priority to be set externally (e.g. an lvar) and only when
;; the planner decides to "jump the track" does it mutate the priority
;; (making it unnecessary here).
