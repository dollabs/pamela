; The output produced by plan-schema (edn and json) is being compared to find coercion issues.
; Note: plan-schema reads edn and json (produced by pamela) and spits out the version of the same after coercion.
; If the coercion is working correctly, output produced by plan-schema should be identical for both.
; If there coercion issues, the output will be different and that's exactly what we are looking for.

; This is output produced by plan-schema after coercion for edn file.
;<  {:uid :hem-100,
;<   :type :htn-expanded-method,
